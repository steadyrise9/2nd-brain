# Second Brain

Second Brain is a local-first AI runtime for your machine, built as a **microkernel**.

The kernel is deliberately small: it boots, runs the agent turn, persists conversations in SQLite, loads and unloads plugins, keeps the lightweight Timekeeper event clock running, and gets out of the way. Everything else — file indexing and retrieval, web search, scheduling workflows, Telegram, durable memory, file-editing and shell tools, heavy file parsers — arrives as **packages** you install from the store. It is not a fixed chatbot wrapped around a folder search, and it is not a monolith either: it is a programmable conversation runtime that you (and agents) extend while it is running.

A fresh install starts almost empty. Run `/setup` and install the `starter` bundle to get a working assistant in one step — see [The Kernel And The Package Store](#the-kernel-and-the-package-store) below.

The most important architectural shift is the conversation layer. Second Brain routes conversations through a robust state machine: participants take actions, turns move between actors, phases suspend and resume multi-step flows, and frontends submit actions instead of owning conversation logic. Commands and frontends are plugins too, so the system can grow new user interfaces and slash-command workflows the same way it grows tools, tasks, and services.

## What It Can Do

With the right packages installed (the `full` bundle covers most of the list below), Second Brain can:

- Index documents, code, PDFs, slides, spreadsheets, archives, images, audio, and video.
- Search local files by keyword, semantics, or hybrid ranking.
- Answer from your own corpus with citations and exact file reads.
- Develop a robust memory library.
- Store and resume conversation history in SQLite.
- Search the public web when local knowledge is not enough.
- Run path-driven indexing tasks and event-driven background jobs.
- Schedule one-time and recurring subagents through Timekeeper cron jobs.
- Use agentskills.io compatible skills.
- Push reminders, findings, daily briefs, and alerts into Telegram.
- Use REPL and Telegram frontends out of the box.
- Author, test, and live-load new tools, tasks, services, commands, and frontends.

The result is a private AI layer for your computer: part knowledge engine, part personal operator, part automation substrate.

## The Kernel And The Package Store

Second Brain ships as a microkernel plus a package store.

**The kernel** is what lives in this repository's main tree. It is almost pure Python and boots *fast*. It boots the runtime, runs the conversation state machine and agent turn, persists conversations, manages config, and discovers and loads plugins. It ships only the plugins it cannot run without: the LLM service, the compactor (context safety), the parser registry (with lightweight text and image parsing), Timekeeper (the event clock), the plugin watcher (live install and reload), the REPL frontend, and a small set of REPL/introspection commands. There are **no built-in tools or tasks** — a fresh kernel can hold a conversation, but it cannot search your files or edit code until you install packages.

**The store** is a parallel branch (`store`) that mirrors what a fully loaded install looks like: every optional tool, task, service, command, frontend, and parser helper, plus named *bundles* that group them. You browse and install from it with `/packages`, and the kernel copies the files into your data directory and live-loads them.

### Getting started

A fresh install has no LLM backend and no frontend beyond the REPL. The fastest path is the onboarding wizard:

```
/setup
```

It installs a bundle, configures an LLM profile, and optionally sets up Telegram. If you would rather drive it by hand, install the starter bundle directly:

```
/packages install bundle_starter
```

The **starter** bundle is the recommended first install: an LLM backend (LiteLLM, which reaches most providers), the Telegram frontend, file read/edit, SQL and shell tools, ask-user-question, plugin authoring, and durable-memory plus auto-title tasks. Note: you cannot chat with an LLM in Second Brain until you install an LLM backend (LiteLLM recommended). For everything else — all file parsers, OCR, audio/video transcription, and the full indexing and search pipeline — install the larger **full** bundle:

```
/packages install bundle_full
```

Browse and manage packages anytime:

```
/packages                      # interactive: browse / install / uninstall
/packages available tools      # list installable tools (or tasks/services/commands/frontends/bundles)
/packages installed            # what you currently have
/packages install <stem>       # install one file by stem, e.g. tool_web_search or parse_pdf
/packages uninstall <stem>     # remove it, plus dependencies nothing else still needs
```

Install resolves each file's declared dependencies — other store files and pip packages — and copies them in. Uninstall removes only files and pip packages nothing else still needs, and never touches kernel requirements. The idea is to have a clean separation between the kernel and plugins that are installed into the kernel.

### Contributing to the store

The store is just a git branch, so adding a plugin is a pull request. Author and test your plugin as a sandbox plugin (see [Plugin System](#plugin-system) and the [Extension Authoring Guide](#extension-authoring-guide)), then open a pull request against the `store` branch that adds your `tool_*.py` / `task_*.py` / `service_*.py` / `command_*.py` / `frontend_*.py` (and any `helpers/`) under the matching family directory. Declare dependencies with the `dependencies_files` and `dependencies_pip` fields so the package manager can resolve them, and to group several files under one install, add a `bundles/<name>.json` manifest listing the store-relative files.

## Core Architecture

Second Brain is built from a few durable pieces:

- `state_machine/` contains the pure conversation primitives: participants, turns, phases, actions, forms, approvals, and serializable phase frames.
- `runtime/` owns sessions, persistence, approvals, state-machine dispatch, agent turns, and the context passed into plugins.
- `plugins/` holds every extension family: tools, tasks, services, commands, and frontends.
- `pipeline/` watches files, manages the SQLite task queue, and runs path-driven and event-driven tasks.
- `agent/` builds the dynamic system prompt, manages the tool registry, and drives LLM tool calls.
- `events/` provides the pub/sub bus used by tasks, progress updates, notifications, and runtime signals.
- `config/` owns core settings plus plugin setting persistence.

The runtime is deliberately split this way so the state machine stays pure, frontends stay transport-specific, and plugins get a stable host API instead of reaching through the whole application.

## Conversation Runtime

The conversation runtime is the heart of the current system.

`ConversationRuntime.handle_action(...)` is the adapter-facing entry point. A frontend, scheduled job, or other driver submits a labeled action such as `send_text`, `send_attachment`, `call_command`, `submit_form_text`, `answer_approval`, or `cancel`. The runtime loads the session, refreshes command and tool specs, enters the state machine, persists the marker, and drives the agent turn when the action hands priority to the agent.

The state machine models conversations the same way a turn-based game does (think Magic: The Gathering):

- participants have permissions and identities
- one participant has turn priority
- actions are legal or illegal depending on phase
- forms and approvals suspend the current flow
- phase frames are serializable, so interrupted flows can be restored
- attachments are carried into the next agent turn with explicit lifecycle rules

Frontends do not own that flow. `BaseFrontend` turns transport input into runtime actions, then renders `RuntimeResult`, attachments, forms, approvals, buttons, errors, and progress events. This is why the REPL and Telegram can share command behavior, approval behavior, form behavior, cancellation, status updates, and session persistence without duplicating the core conversation logic.

## Plugin System

Everything user-extensible is a plugin family:

| Family | Built-in path | Sandbox path | Contract |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tools | `plugins/tools/` | `sandbox_tools/` | LLM-callable actions via `BaseTool` |
| Tasks | `plugins/tasks/` | `sandbox_tasks/` | Pipeline and event work via `BaseTask` |
| Services | `plugins/services/` | `sandbox_services/` | Shared backends via `BaseService` |
| Commands | `plugins/commands/` | `sandbox_commands/` | User slash commands via `BaseCommand` |
| Frontends | `plugins/frontends/` | `sandbox_frontends/` | User transports via `BaseFrontend` |

Built-in plugins are source-controlled. Sandbox plugins live in the Second Brain data directory and can be created while the app is running. Valid plugins are discovered on startup; when `plugin_watcher` is in `autoload_services`, adds, edits, and deletes are synced live.

The agent can create new plugins on-the-fly. These are the instructions given to the agent for authoring new plugins:

1. Read the relevant template in `templates/`.
2. Read a similar built-in plugin.
3. Create or edit the plugin file with `edit_file`.
4. Let `plugin_watcher` auto-load the file when it is enabled, and call `test_plugin(plugin_path=...)` for purpose-built diagnostics.
5. If testing fails, fix the same file and call `test_plugin` again. Repeat until it is fixed and the plugin loads.
6. To remove it durably and from the live runtime, delete the sandbox file; `plugin_watcher` unloads it when enabled.

That loop matters. Second Brain can inspect its own templates, write a focused extension, diagnose it, and use it immediately. `test_plugin` gives the plugin-specific signal; its pytest section is broad regression context, not proof that the new plugin's behavior is complete. A new command is not a special case. A new frontend is not a rewrite. They are plugins with contracts.

## Security

Second Brain has protections against rogue plugins and AIs. Tools, tasks, and service loads are given a timeout; if they can't get the job done within that timeframe, it gets cancelled. This fixes freezes. Second Brain also monitors memory usage through the Plugin Supervisor, which automatically quarantines plugins that exceed the threshold. However, all plugins run in-process, which means that there are no subprocesses. If a plugin calls `os._exit()`, it will take down the whole process. Make sure you trust plugins before adding them to your runtime. When writing new plugins for Second Brain, you should use an intelligent model that won't mess things up.

## File Indexing And Retrieval

Indexing and retrieval are store capabilities — install the `full` bundle (or the indexing/search and parser bundles) to enable them. Once installed, point Second Brain at folders with `sync_directories` and it keeps a live SQLite knowledge base over those files. The kernel always ships the pipeline *substrate* (file watcher, task queue, orchestrator DAG); these packages add the processing stages that run on it.

The full pipeline includes:

- file watching and debounced change detection
- parser service dispatch by extension and modality
- text extraction
- OCR for images
- speech-to-text for audio and video (`service_whisper` + `parse_voice` enable Telegram speech-to-text)
- archive/container extraction
- tabular textualization
- text chunking
- text embeddings
- image embeddings
- lexical full-text indexing
- dependency invalidation when upstream file outputs change

Search tools include:

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `hybrid_search` | Best default local search over indexed files |
| `lexical_search` | Exact terms and keyword-heavy queries |
| `semantic_search` | Meaning-based retrieval over embeddings |
| `sql_query` | Read-only inspection of the SQLite database |
| `read_file` | Exact text reads from source, docs, templates, or sandbox plugins |
| `render_files` | Return local files to the frontend |

Supported modalities:

| Modality | Examples |
|---|---|
| Text | `.txt`, `.md`, `.py`, `.js`, `.ts`, `.html`, `.css`, `.json`, `.yaml`, `.toml`, `.xml`, `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.pptx`, `.gdoc` |
| Image | `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.webp`, `.tiff`, `.bmp`, `.ico`, `.heic`, `.heif` |
| Audio | `.wav`, `.mp3`, `.flac`, `.ogg`, `.m4a`, `.aac`, `.wma` |
| Video | `.mp4`, `.mkv`, `.avi`, `.mov`, `.webm`, `.wmv`, `.flv` |
| Tabular | `.csv`, `.tsv`, `.xlsx`, `.xls`, `.parquet`, `.feather`, `.sqlite`, `.db` |
| Container | `.zip`, `.tar`, `.gz`, `.7z`, `.rar` |

## Events, Cron Jobs, And Subagents

Second Brain is proactive, not just reactive — once the scheduling package is installed:

`/packages install bundle_scheduling`

Path-driven tasks process files. Event-driven tasks respond to bus events. Timekeeper is the kernel service that creates one-time and recurring event emissions using cron expressions; the `bundle_scheduling` package adds the `/schedule` command, scheduled-subagent task, and scheduling tool on top. Scheduled subagents can wake up, read their conversation history, run tools, and optionally send their final result back into chat, depending on their notification mode.

This supports workflows like:

- reminders and follow-ups
- daily or weekly briefings
- recurring research checks
- inbox checks and message triage
- "watch this folder and tell me what changed"
- scheduled maintenance or database cleanup
- background subagents that remember prior runs

It is calendar-capable without being trapped in a traditional calendar UI. Jobs can run silently or notify the active frontend, and subagent conversations remain available through the conversation system. That doesn't mean Google/Apple Calendar can't be added to Second Brain — they can.

## Frontends

The kernel ships one base frontend, the REPL (`frontend_repl.py`, a local terminal interface). Telegram — a private mobile chat interface (`frontend_telegram.py`) — is a store package, installed with the `bundle_starter`/`bundle_full` bundles or directly via `/packages install frontend_telegram`. Both live under `plugins/frontends/` once present.

`BaseFrontend` provides the shared runtime binding, command parsing path, form and approval submission, bus subscriptions, progress rendering hooks, session helpers, and `FrontendCapabilities` model. Each frontend implements only the transport-specific parts: receiving input, deriving a session key, rendering messages, sending attachments, showing buttons, and stopping cleanly.

Telegram is useful because the local runtime can reach you anywhere: approvals, proactive reminders, file delivery, scheduled-agent results, and mobile command menus all become part of the same conversation system.

Custom frontends are first-class plugins. A Discord bot, HTTP bridge, desktop shell, or narrow operational UI can be built as a sandbox frontend, tested with `test_plugin`, and live-loaded by `plugin_watcher` when enabled.

## Setup

### Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- An LLM profile for agent features (installed and configured by `/setup`) — technically optional, but you won't be able to chat without it.
- A Telegram bot token and allowed user ID if you install the Telegram frontend, which is highly recommended.
- For the OCR/transcription packages: Windows native OCR or macOS Apple Vision; audio/video transcription pulls `faster-whisper`

### Install

```bash
git clone <https://github.com/steadyrise9/2nd-brain.git>
cd "2nd-brain"
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

`requirements.txt` is intentionally minimal — the kernel stays close to pure Python (`watchdog`, `croniter`, `psutil`, and a few others). Heavier dependencies (`openai`/`litellm`, `Pillow`, `sentence-transformers`, `faster-whisper`, `PyMuPDF`, `python-docx`, `python-pptx`, `pandas`, `python-telegram-bot`, …) belong to store packages and are installed automatically when you install the package that needs them.

### Configure

On first run, Second Brain creates its data directory automatically:

- Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%/Second Brain/`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Second Brain/`
- Linux: `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/Second Brain/`

From there, `/setup` writes the LLM profile and Telegram settings for you, and installing packages extends `enabled_frontends`/`autoload_services` as needed. A fresh kernel starts with `enabled_frontends: ["repl"]` and `autoload_services: ["llm", "timekeeper"]`.

The most important setting once indexing is installed is `sync_directories`: the folders Second Brain should watch and index. The attachment cache is included by default so files sent through frontends can enter the same pipeline. You can add multiple folders here, and they all get synced automatically. As soon as you set a sync directory, the REPL and app.log will be flooded with task status messages. Don't worry — that's the sync working as intended. It'll stop once the sync is complete. (You can use Telegram if you prefer a cleaner chat experience.)

Illustrative shape after the `starter` bundle and `/setup` (LiteLLM backend, Telegram enabled):

```json
{
  "sync_directories": [
    "C:/Users/you/Documents",
    "C:/Users/you/AppData/Local/Second Brain/attachment_cache"
  ],
  "enabled_frontends": ["repl", "telegram"],
  "autoload_services": ["llm", "timekeeper"],
  "telegram_bot_token": "",
  "telegram_allowed_user_id": 0,
  "llm_profiles": {
    "default": {
      "llm_endpoint": "https://api.atlascloud.ai/v1",
      "llm_api_key": "ATLAS_API_KEY",
      "llm_context_size": 0,
      "llm_service_class": "LiteLLMService"
    }
  },
  "default_llm_profile": "default",
  "agent_profiles": {
    "default": {
      "llm": "default",
      "prompt_suffix": "",
      "whitelist_or_blacklist_tools": "blacklist",
      "tools_list": []
    }
  }
}
```

Notes:

- Run `/setup` for guided onboarding; it installs a bundle and writes the LLM/Telegram config.
- Configure LLM profiles with `/llm`, agent profiles with `/agent`, and app/plugin settings with `/config`.
- `llm_context_size: 0` lets automatic compaction manage context.
- `LiteLLMService` (from the `starter` bundle) reaches most providers; point `llm_endpoint`/`llm_api_key` at whichever you use.
- Each `llm_profiles` entry is registered as its own service, and the `llm` router follows `default_llm_profile`.
- Installed extension services auto-load when present; you don't need to list them in `autoload_services`.

### Run

```bash
python main.py
```

Startup does the following:

1. Loads config and plugin config.
2. Creates data, attachment, and sandbox directories.
3. Initializes SQLite.
4. Discovers services, tasks, tools, commands, and frontends.
5. Starts the task orchestrator.
6. Starts the filesystem watcher.
7. Starts the event-trigger runner.
8. Launches enabled frontends.

## Commands And Tools

Commands are user-facing plugins. They are available in the REPL and Telegram as slash commands, and they can collect forms through the state machine.

The kernel ships REPL UX and introspection commands only:

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/setup` | Guided onboarding: install a bundle, configure the LLM and Telegram |
| `/packages` | Browse, install, and uninstall store packages and bundles |
| `/agent` | Select, switch, edit, or remove agent profiles |
| `/llm` | Select, edit, set default, or remove LLM profiles |
| `/config` | Select and edit config and plugin settings |
| `/conversations` | Browse, switch, and manage conversations |
| `/clear` | Clear the current conversation |
| `/cancel` | Cancel the current interaction |
| `/frontends` | Enable or disable frontend plugins |
| `/services` | Select and load or unload services |
| `/tasks` | Pause, resume, reset, retry, or trigger tasks |
| `/tools` | Select and call tools |
| `/commands` | List available commands |
| `/locations` | Show project and plugin directories |
| `/debug` | Inspect runtime state & recent errors |
| `/update` | Pull most recent Repo state |

Other commands (for example `/schedule` for cron jobs, or MCP commands) arrive with the packages that provide them.

The kernel ships **no built-in tools** — a fresh install can converse but has no agent-callable actions. Tools come from the store; the `starter` and `full` bundles install the common ones, and you can add others individually with `/packages install <stem>`. Frequently installed tools include:

| Tool | Purpose | Bundle |
|---|---|---|
| `read_file` | Read exact text from files | starter |
| `edit_file` | Create, overwrite, replace, append to, or delete UTF-8 text files | starter |
| `run_command` | Run scoped terminal commands, with approval for broad actions | starter |
| `sql_query` | Query SQLite read-only | starter |
| `ask_user_question` | Ask the user a structured question | starter |
| `test_plugin` | Diagnose a plugin source file and summarize broad regression tests | starter |
| `hybrid_search` | Search local files with fused lexical and semantic ranking | full |
| `lexical_search` | Search local files by exact terms and keywords | full |
| `semantic_search` | Search local files by embedding similarity | full |
| `web_search` | Search the public web | web_search |

## Extension Authoring Guide

Use the templates as the source of truth:

- `templates/tool_template.py`
- `templates/task_template.py`
- `templates/service_template.py`
- `templates/command_template.py`
- `templates/frontend_template.py`

Authoring rules:

- Tools expose LLM-callable capabilities and return `ToolResult`.
- Tasks are pipeline/event workers and should be idempotent where possible.
- Services own reusable backends with explicit load/unload lifecycle.
- Commands are user-facing conversation actions and can define `FormStep` flows.
- Frontends are transports; they submit runtime actions and render runtime output.
- Plugins can declare `config_settings`, which appear in config views and are stored in `plugin_config.json`.
- Sandbox plugins must follow naming conventions: `tool_*.py`, `task_*.py`, `service_*.py`, `command_*.py`, and `frontend_*.py`.

For source-controlled additions, move stable sandbox plugins into the matching built-in plugin directory. For live experimentation, keep them in the data directory, call `test_plugin`, and let `plugin_watcher` load them when it is enabled.

## Philosophy

Think of Second Brain like a blank canvas. It starts off plain and simple, with no tools or tasks involved, no bells and whistles. It's something you are meant to expand yourself. You can build on it and make it your own. It's fully open-source, so you could change the kernel however you want. The Second Brain core code is so versatile and strong that it can turn into almost any shape. What's cool is that Second Brain can change itself. It's not like a typical coding project, where all of the changes come from you. The agent has the power to change itself. Make it into a website, a shop, a robot backend, a highly personal assistant. All of this is possible because of how modular and extensible Second Brain is. And the name itself: Although Second Brain is still a ways off from being like a human brain, it can still do quite a lot, and I think it is worthy of the name. The goal has always been to create something intelligent, adaptable, and useful. Those are the three things that have driven this from the start.
